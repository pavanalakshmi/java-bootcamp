Problem 1: Find Maximum in Array - MaxValInArray.java
Write a Java program to find the maximum value in an array of integers.


Problem 2: Palindrome Check - Palindrome.java
================================================================================================================
Objective
Write a Java program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case differences.

Steps to Implement Palindrome Check
Input the string: Take a string as input from the user.
Normalize the string: Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert it to lower case.
Check for palindrome:
Compare characters from the beginning and end of the string moving towards the center.
If all corresponding characters match, the string is a palindrome.
Output the result: Print whether the string is a palindrome or not.

Problem 3:
Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

Requirements:
Use classes to model the calculator.
Use control flow statements to handle invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).


4,5,6,7 - OddAndEven.java
4- Print first 50 odd numbers
5 Print first 50 even numbers
6 Add the first 50 even numbers and print the sum
7 Add the first 50 odd numbers and print the sum


8 Calculate the factorial of number n (1 >> n <= 12) Factorial.java

9 Print the first n number in the fibonacci series ( 1 >> n << 100)  -- Fibonacci.java
================================================================================================================
For Fibonacci series.

Hereâ€™s a simple explanation of how to generate the Fibonacci series for a number:

Start with the first two numbers of the series, which are 0 and 1.
To get the next number in the series, add the two previous numbers together.
Keep adding the last two numbers to get the next number, and continue this process.
Let's generate the first 8 numbers in the Fibonacci series as an example:

Start with 0 and 1.
0 + 1 = 1 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1)
1 + 1 = 2 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1, 2)
1 + 2 = 3 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3)
2 + 3 = 5 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)
3 + 5 = 8 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
5 + 8 = 13 (So the series is now: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
And you can keep going as long as you want.

In summary, to generate the Fibonacci series:

Start with 0 and 1.
Add the last two numbers to get the next number in the series.
Repeat the process to get as many numbers in the series as you need.
